# LGPD Compliance Dashboard

## Overview

This is a Python-based LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados) compliance system that automatically scans documents for personal data, extracts and classifies the information, and provides a dashboard for analysis. The system uses regex patterns, spaCy NLP for named entity recognition, and provides OCR capabilities for scanned documents.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular pipeline architecture with the following key components:

- **File Scanner**: Recursively scans directories for supported file formats
- **File Reader**: Extracts text from multiple document formats including OCR for PDFs
- **Data Extractor**: Uses regex patterns and spaCy NLP to identify personal data and data subjects
- **Database Layer**: SQLite database for storing extracted data with LGPD compliance focus
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit-based web interface for data visualization and analysis

## Key Components

### File Processing Pipeline
- **file_scanner.py**: Handles recursive directory traversal and file discovery
- **file_reader.py**: Multi-format document text extraction (TXT, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, MSG)
- **data_extractor.py**: Personal data identification using regex and NLP

### Data Management
- **database.py**: SQLite database operations with LGPD-specific schema
- **main.py**: Main orchestration pipeline that coordinates all components

### User Interface
- **web_interface.py**: Flask web application with modern dashboard for data visualization and compliance reporting
- **templates/dashboard.html**: HTML template with elegant design and real-time processing status

### Supported File Formats
- Plain text files (.txt)
- PDF documents (.pdf) with OCR support
- Word documents (.docx)
- Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx)
- CSV files (.csv)
- Outlook emails (.msg)

## Data Flow

1. **Document Discovery**: File scanner recursively searches the `data/` directory
2. **Text Extraction**: File reader extracts text content from various document formats
3. **Data Identification**: Regex patterns identify Brazilian personal data (CPF, RG, email, phone, etc.)
4. **Context Analysis**: System captures 150-character context windows around identified data
5. **Subject Identification**: Uses keyword matching and spaCy NER to identify data subjects
6. **Classification**: Automatically classifies data priority (high priority for CPF, RG, email, phone)
7. **Storage**: Saves extracted data to SQLite database with metadata
8. **Visualization**: Dashboard provides compliance overview and detailed analysis

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **streamlit**: Web dashboard framework
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **plotly**: Interactive data visualization
- **sqlite3**: Database operations
- **spacy**: Natural language processing and NER
- **pdfplumber**: PDF text extraction

### NLP Models
- **pt_core_news_lg**: Large Portuguese spaCy model (primary)
- **pt_core_news_sm**: Small Portuguese spaCy model (fallback)

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for Replit deployment with the following considerations:

- **Database**: Uses SQLite for simplicity and no external database requirements
- **File Storage**: Local file system storage in `data/` directory
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies listed in requirements.txt for easy installation
- **Configuration**: Minimal configuration required, with fallback mechanisms for missing components

### Database Schema
```sql
dados_extraidos (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    arquivo TEXT NOT NULL,
    titular TEXT NOT NULL,
    campo TEXT NOT NULL,
    valor TEXT NOT NULL,
    contexto TEXT,
    prioridade TEXT,
    origem_identificacao TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

### Key Features
- **Automated Data Subject Identification**: Uses contextual keywords and NLP
- **Three-Tier Priority Classification**: Categorizes data as Alta, Média, or Baixa criticality per LGPD
- **Priority Company Search**: Configurable enterprise ranking system with domain filtering
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Dashboard with statistics, Excel export, and detailed compliance views
- **Brazilian Compliance Focus**: Regex patterns optimized for Brazilian document formats
- **Multi-format Support**: Handles common business document formats
- **OCR Integration**: Processes scanned documents and images
- **Real-time Processing Monitoring**: Progress tracking with file-by-file status updates

## User Preferences
